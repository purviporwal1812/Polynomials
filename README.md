# Polynomial Operations Project

This Java-based polynomial operations project facilitates various operations on polynomials through an interactive menu-driven approach. It allows users to perform multiple operations until they choose to exit by selecting the appropriate option from the menu.

## Key Functionalities

### Finding Roots of Quadratic Equations

- **Function:** Allows users to calculate the roots of quadratic equations.

### Performing Polynomial Addition

- **Function:** Performs addition of two polynomials.

### Performing Polynomial Subtraction

- **Function:** Performs subtraction of two polynomials.

### Performing Polynomial Multiplication

- **Function:** Performs multiplication of two polynomials.

### Substituting a Value for 'x' in a Polynomial

- **Function:** Enables users to substitute a value for 'x' in a polynomial equation.

### Computing Polynomial Derivatives

- **Function:** Computes the derivative of a given polynomial.
